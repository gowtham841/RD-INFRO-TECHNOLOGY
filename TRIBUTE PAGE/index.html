                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Mozart most commonly called himself Wolfgang Amadé or Wolfgang Gottlieb. His father, Leopold, came from a family of good standing (from which he was estranged), which included architects and bookbinders. Leopold was the author of a famous violin-playing manual, which was published in the very year of Mozart’s birth. His mother, Anna Maria Pertl, was born of a middle-class family active in local administration. Mozart and his sister Maria Anna (“Nannerl”) were the only two of their seven children to survive.The boy’s early talent for music was remarkable. At three he was picking out chords on the harpsichord, at four playing short pieces, at five composing. There are anecdotes about his precise memory of pitch, about his scribbling a concerto at the age of five, and about his gentleness and sensitivity (he was afraid of the trumpet). Just before he was six, his father took him and Nannerl, also highly talented, to Munich to play at the Bavarian court, and a few months later they went to Vienna and were heard at the imperial court and in noble houses.

                 <p>
                    Mozart’s life was a blend of genius and hardship. Despite his extraordinary talent, he faced financial instability, often struggling to secure steady patronage. Though he gained fame, his lavish lifestyle and poor money management led to frequent debts. In 1782, he married Constanze Weber, and while their marriage was loving, they endured personal tragedies, including the loss of several children. Professionally, he faced rivalries in the competitive Viennese music scene, with rumors of tension between him and composer Antonio Salieri. His health also deteriorated over the years, and his sudden death at the age of 35 remains a mystery, with theories ranging from poisoning to natural causes. Despite these struggles, Mozart’s music continues to inspire and influence the world.
